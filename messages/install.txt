Edit I made to the material theme for sublime text to go well with the Facebook color scheme.

Original Repo: https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme

Facebook Color Scheme: http://colorsublime.com/?q=facebook (there's a ST plugin for colorsublime if you want to grab that)

Installation:
"theme": "Material-Theme.sublime-theme",
